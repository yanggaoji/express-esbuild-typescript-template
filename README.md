# express-esbuild-typescript-template

A minimal template for building a TypeScript-based Express application using esbuild for fast builds and hot reloading.
This template is designed to be simple and easy to use, making it a great starting point for your next Express project.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Build for production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create a production-ready build in the `dist` folder.

4.  **Run the production server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
